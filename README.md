# Mini OS Simulator
## 🎬 Project Demo: A demo Video Sample: use speed 1.5x for better https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=y1YXhT6nuwIIKzu9&v=i_erC_ef08E&feature=youtu.be


## 📌 Project Overview
The **Mini OS Simulator** is a simplified simulation of core **Operating System concepts**.  
This project is **(not a real operating system)**, for understanding how a different algorithm works internally using hands-on implementation.

The simulator focuses on important OS topics covered in the syllabus, such as:
- Process Management & CPU Scheduling  
- Memory Management  
- File Management  
- I/O Device Simulation & Disk Scheduling
  
  ```[Further Exploration: Learners are encouraged to be proactive and explore additional OS algorithms concepts independently.```

A GUI-based approach is used to make the concepts easier to visualize and understand.

---

##  Objectives
- To understand core operating system concepts through simulation
- To implement OS algorithms studied in the syllabus
- To gain practical experience with the algorithms and concepts

---

## 🧠 OS Concepts (Syllabus-Based)

The topic of the Mini OS Simulator project can be chosen from any of the core Operating System concepts covered in the syllabus. Students are free to **choose any one topic as the main project focus** or combine multiple OS concepts to build a more comprehensive Mini OS Simulator.


Example topics include:

### 1. Process Management & CPU Scheduling
Algorithms Like:
- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Round Robin Scheduling**

Concepts can be:
- Arrival Time, Burst Time
- Waiting Time and Turnaround Time
- Gantt Chart visualization

---

### 2.Memory Management
Algorithms Like:
- **First Fit**
- **Best Fit**
- **Worst Fit**

Concepts can be:
- Fixed memory blocks
- Memory allocation and deallocation
- Internal and external fragmentation

---

### 3. File Management
Features :
- File creation
- File deletion
- File attributes (file name, size, type)

Concepts can be:
- Basic file operations
- Logical file organization
- Simple directory structure

---

### 4. I/O Device Simulation & Disk Management
Algorithms implemented:
- **FCFS Disk Scheduling**
- **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**
- **SCAN / LOOK** (if applicable)

Concepts covered:
- Disk head movement
- Seek time calculation
- I/O request scheduling
