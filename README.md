# Mini OS Simulator

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Mini OS Simulator** is a simplified simulation of core **Operating System concepts**.  
This project is **not a real operating system**, but a learning tool designed to help students understand how an OS works internally using hands-on implementation.

The simulator focuses on important OS topics covered in the syllabus such as:
- Process Management & CPU Scheduling  
- Memory Management  
- File Management  
- I/O Device Simulation & Disk Scheduling  

A GUI-based approach is used to make the concepts easier to visualize and understand.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand core operating system concepts through simulation
- To implement OS algorithms studied in the syllabus
- To visualize scheduling, allocation, and management techniques
- To gain practical experience with OS concepts
