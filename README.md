# Mini OS Simulator
## 🎬 Project Demo: A demo Video Sample: https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=y1YXhT6nuwIIKzu9&v=i_erC_ef08E&feature=youtu.be


## 📌 Project Overview
The **Mini OS Simulator** is a simplified simulation of core **Operating System concepts**.  
This project is **(not a real operating system)**, for understanding how a different algorithm works internally using hands-on implementation.

The simulator focuses on important OS topics covered in the syllabus, such as:
- Process Management & CPU Scheduling  
- Memory Management  
- File Management  
- I/O Device Simulation & Disk Scheduling   [Further Exploration: Learners are encouraged to be proactive and explore additional OS algorithms concepts independently.

A GUI-based approach is used to make the concepts easier to visualize and understand.

##  Objectives
- To understand core operating system concepts through simulation
- To implement OS algorithms studied in the syllabus
- To gain practical experience with the algorithms and concepts

---
